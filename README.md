# Law of Large Numbers – Coin Flip Simulation

This project demonstrates the Law of Large Numbers using a Monte Carlo
simulation of Bernoulli trials (coin flips).

Each run tracks the running mean of outcomes as the number of trials increases.
Multiple independent trials are plotted to show how variance decreases and
estimates converge to the true probability.

## Concepts Demonstrated
- Monte Carlo simulation
- Running averages
- Convergence in probability
- Variance reduction with sample size

## Usage
```bash
python law_of_large_numbers.py
